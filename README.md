## Galvanize Data Science Bootcamp Capstone-3 Project
# Proposal 1:
Predict the status of a genetic biomarker important for brain cancer treatment. This model will be trained, tested and validated using Radiological Society of North America 400,000 anonymized multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans in DICOM format.  MpMRI scan images are available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification/data

# Proposal 2:
Use GANs to create art. This model will be trained, tested and validated using data available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started/data

# Proposal 3:
Detecting contradiction and entailment in multilingual text using  CNN, RNN, NLP, and LSTM. This model will be trained, tested and validated using data available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/contradictory-my-dear-watson/data
