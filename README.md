# Detecting Contradiction and Entailment In Multilingual Text Using Self-Attention Transformer Models - BERT, DistilBERT and RoBERTa
Training data is pairs of two sentences (consisting of a premise and a hypothesis) classified into three categories Entailment, Neutral or Contradiction. Training data contains premise hypothesis pairs in fifteen different languages, including: Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, German, Greek, English, Spanish, French, Hindi, Russian, Swahili, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, and Vietnamese is avaiable at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/contradictory-my-dear-watson/data

# Conclusion
In conclusion XLM-RoBERTa-Large model performed better on English. The accuracies for low resource languages is unsatisfactory. In future, to make this model better I will need to develop more complex Self-Attention Transformer models and see if there are any more hyperparameters that can be tweaked for better performance. So work still in progress.
